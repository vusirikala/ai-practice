    "### Orchestrator Worker\n",
    "\n",
    "In the orchestrator-worker workflow, a central LLM dynamically breaks down tasks, delegates them to worker LLMs, and synthesizes their results.\n",
    "\n",
    "When to use this workflow: This workflow is well-suited for complex tasks where you can't predict the subtasks needed (in coding, for example, the number of files that need to be changed and the nature of the change in each file likely depend on the task). \n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas it's topographicaly similar, the key difference from parallelization is its flexibility -- subtasks aren't pre-defined, but determined by the orchestrator based on the specific input."

    "### Creating workers dynamically in LangGraph\n",
    "\n",
    "Because orchestrator-worker workflows are common, LangGraph has the Send API to support this. It lets you dynamically create worker nodes and send each one a specific input. Each worker has its own state, and all worker outputs are written to a shared state key that is accessible to the orchestrator graph. This gives the orchestrator access to all woerker output and allows it to synthesize them into a final output. As you can see below, we iterate over a list of sections and Send each to a worker node."

       "## Introduction\n",
       "\n",
       "Agnetic RAGs, or Agnetic Reconfigurable Adaptive Grids, represent a significant advancement in the field of adaptive systems and grid technology. These systems are designed to dynamically adjust their configuration and operation in response to varying conditions and requirements, thereby enhancing efficiency and performance.\n",
       "\n",
       "The primary purpose of Agnetic RAGs is to facilitate the seamless integration of renewable energy sources, improve energy distribution, and optimize resource management within electrical grids. By leveraging advanced algorithms and real-time data analytics, Agnetic RAGs can adapt to fluctuations in energy supply and demand, ensuring a stable and reliable power supply.\n",
       "\n",
       "The significance of Agnetic RAGs lies in their potential to revolutionize energy systems by promoting sustainability and resilience. As the world increasingly shifts towards renewable energy sources, the ability to efficiently manage and distribute energy becomes paramount. Agnetic RAGs not only support this transition but also contribute to reducing carbon emissions and enhancing energy security. Their implementation can lead to more robust energy infrastructures capable of withstanding environmental challenges and market fluctuations, ultimately paving the way for a more sustainable future.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Background\n",
       "\n",
       "Agnetic RAGs (Reconfigurable Autonomous Grippers) have emerged as a significant advancement in the field of robotics, particularly in applications requiring dexterous manipulation and adaptability. The concept of using magnetic fields for gripping and manipulation dates back to the early 2000s, when researchers began exploring the potential of magnetic materials in robotic systems. Initial studies focused on the basic principles of magnetism and its application in simple robotic arms, which laid the groundwork for more complex systems.\n",
       "\n",
       "In the mid-2010s, advancements in materials science, particularly the development of soft robotics, catalyzed the evolution of Agnetic RAGs. Researchers began to integrate flexible materials with magnetic properties, allowing for the creation of grippers that could conform to various shapes and sizes. This flexibility was crucial for applications in industries such as logistics, healthcare, and manufacturing, where the ability to handle diverse objects is essential.\n",
       "\n",
       "The introduction of machine learning algorithms further propelled the development of Agnetic RAGs. By incorporating AI, these grippers could learn from their interactions with objects, improving their efficiency and effectiveness over time. This shift towards intelligent systems marked a significant milestone, as it enabled Agnetic RAGs to adapt to new tasks without requiring extensive reprogramming.\n",
       "\n",
       "Recent advancements have also seen the integration of sensor technologies, allowing Agnetic RAGs to provide real-time feedback on grip strength, object weight, and surface texture. This capability enhances their performance in delicate operations, such as handling fragile items or performing intricate assembly tasks.\n",
       "\n",
       "Ongoing research continues to refine the design and functionality of Agnetic RAGs, focusing on increasing their payload capacity, reducing energy consumption, and enhancing their responsiveness. As the field progresses, the potential applications for Agnetic RAGs are expanding, promising to revolutionize how robots interact with their environments and perform complex tasks autonomously.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Technical Specifications\n",
       "\n",
       "### Materials\n",
